# This demo is for:
- Pick Video For User's Gallery
- Pick Audio
- Merge audio and video
- Trim the output on specific time
- if the audio is shorter than the video the audio will be repeated over the video period  

## The libraries i used to do so are:
  - [ffmpeg_kit_flutter](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html)
  - [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) for fetching the path of the app to put the output inside
  - [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) for displaying the merged output 
  - [file_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker) for picking the audio and video from the user's device
